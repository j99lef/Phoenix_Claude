# School Holidays Data Strategy

## Current Situation

The existing `uk-schools-database.js` contains **manually created** holiday dates for only a few councils. This is not sustainable and doesn't provide comprehensive UK coverage.

## The Problem

1. **No centralized UK government API** for school holidays
2. **Each council sets their own dates** 
3. **Independent schools vary further**
4. **Current data is static and will become outdated**

## Real-World Solutions

### Option 1: Government Data Sources
- **data.gov.uk**: Search for council-published datasets
- **Individual council APIs**: Some councils may have unpublished endpoints
- **Bank holidays API**: Use gov.uk/bank-holidays API (already available)

### Option 2: Commercial API
- **PredictHQ**: Provides UK school holidays API with student counts
- **Cost**: Paid service but comprehensive and maintained

### Option 3: Web Scraping Approach
- **Target councils**: Birmingham, Manchester, Westminster, Camden, etc.
- **Automation**: Schedule daily/weekly scraping
- **Format**: Convert to standardized JSON

### Option 4: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
1. **Start with major councils**: Manually collect 2025 dates for top 20 councils
2. **Add gov.uk bank holidays API**: Easy win for national holidays  
3. **Build scraper gradually**: Add automated collection over time
4. **User fallback**: Let users add their specific school if not found

## Implementation Priority

1. **Fix authentication FIRST** (current blocker)
2. **Add bank holidays integration** (easy win)
3. **Expand manual data** for 2025 school year
4. **Build council website scrapers** (longer term)

## Current Status

The manual data in `uk-schools-database.js` covers ~10 councils. Need to expand to 100+ councils for real coverage.

**Bottom line**: Yes, currently users need to add their school manually if it's not in our limited database. This should be clearly communicated.
