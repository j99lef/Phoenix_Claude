# Schools/Council Feature - Current Status

## What Actually Works

✅ **User can add their school/council to profile**  
✅ **School data is stored in database**  
✅ **Basic UK council data exists for ~10 councils**  
✅ **Bank holidays integration available**  

## What Doesn't Work Yet

❌ **Comprehensive UK school holiday coverage** - Only major councils included  
❌ **Automatic school holiday updates** - Data is manually maintained  
❌ **Integration with travel brief suggestions** - Not fully implemented  

## Current School Holiday Data

The system includes holiday dates for these councils:
- London: Barking & Dagenham, Camden, Westminster
- Major cities: Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool
- Some other councils: ~10 total

**This covers approximately 5% of UK schools.**

## How It Should Work (Vision)

1. User adds their child's school/council
2. System automatically suggests travel dates based on:
   - School holidays (half terms, summer holidays)
   - INSET days (extended weekends)
   - Bank holidays
3. Travel briefs get smart date suggestions
4. Deal alerts prioritize school holiday periods

## Current Reality

1. User adds school - ✅ **THIS WORKS**
2. System shows basic holiday info - ⚠️ **LIMITED DATA**
3. Travel suggestions - ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**
4. Deal prioritization - ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

## What Users Need to Do

1. **Add your school/council manually** if not found
2. **Check holiday dates yourself** for now
3. **Set travel brief dates manually** 

## Technical Solution Needed

1. **Immediate**: Fix authentication so schools can be added
2. **Short term**: Expand manual holiday database 
3. **Long term**: Build council website scrapers
4. **Integration**: Connect holiday data to travel suggestions

## Is This Feature Useful?

**Current state**: Basic functionality only  
**Full vision**: Would be very valuable for families  
**Recommendation**: Fix core functionality first, expand data later
