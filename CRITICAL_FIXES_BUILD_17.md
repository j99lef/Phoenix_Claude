# CRITICAL FIXES - Build 17

## VERIFIED WORKING LOCALLY

### 1. Schools/Council Fix ✅
**Problem**: Schools API returning 404 because admin user had no database record
**Solution**: 
- Fixed auth.py to require database users (removed placeholder with id=0)
- Created migration script to ensure admin user exists in database
- All schools routes now use auth.get_current_user() properly

**Verified**:
- Admin user exists in database with ID 3
- Schools can be added/retrieved/deleted
- API returns proper data when authenticated

### 2. Deals Functionality Fix ✅
**Problem**: Deals were not being saved to database
**Solution**:
- Added save_deal_to_database() method to travel_agent.py
- Integrated saving into process_travel_brief workflow
- Deals are now saved after being found and analyzed

**Verified**:
- Deals can be created and retrieved
- Deal model works with proper fields
- API returns deals for authenticated users

### 3. Authentication Fix ✅
**Problem**: Admin user authentication not working properly
**Solution**:
- Ensured admin user exists in database
- Fixed get_current_user() to return None if no DB user
- Session properly tracks login_time for auth checks
